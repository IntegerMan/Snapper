Snapper is a [NuGet library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Snapper) which captures snapshots of objects to simplify testing.
It is very heavily based on Jest Snapshot Testing.

See [https://theramis.github.io/Snapper/](https://theramis.github.io/Snapper/) for more documentation.

## Todo
- Create sample project
- Add logo to Nuget
- Write tests for testing json store.
- Update nuget package descriptions for xunit and nunit to say they have extra features
- Figure out all of the .netstandards to target and lowest nuget package versions
